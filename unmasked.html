        “For one night a year, a spirit descends to the town. Six masked
        volunteers shall enter the temple to participate in this secret ritual,
        and one shall become the Spirit’s vessel. Each volunteer has a desire to
        seek out the Spirit and reveal themself to It. However, to reveal
        yourself to the wrong person risks misfortune. It is up to you how the
        ritual will end. Will you discover what lies under the Spirit's mask?”
