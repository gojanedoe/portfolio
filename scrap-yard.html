        <i>Scrap Yard: Innovators of Recycling</i> is an educational board game
        made for the Jewish Museum of Maryland's 2019-2020 exhibit of the same
        name. Within the education department, I designed the game's assets,
        including a board, 18 cards, money, and a set of rules.

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <ul class="medium-block-space">
        <li>
          Bold lines and colors were chosen to appeal to a younger age group,
          which simplified the graphic style and made the game text easier to
          read
        </li>
        <li>
          Facts were added on the back of each card to keep students engaged
          when it wasn't their turn
        </li>
        <li>
          The game's goal was simplified to be about the recycling business
          experience, allowing students to focus on math and strategy skills
          while buying, selling, and adding up profits
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Gameplay & Rules</h2>
      <p class="small-block-space">
        In the finished game, students are a part of a historical scrap
        yard-owning family. The students first learn in the exhibit about their
        respective families, and then split up into groups against other
        families to play.
      </p>
      <p class="small-block-space">
        Gameplay includes rounds to buy and sell different scrap items. Students
        utilize math skills to calculate how much their scrap is worth
        throughout and at the end of the game to find out who made the most
        profit. They also learn about the supply and demand model during the
        selling phase, since the price they get when selling in the
        "marketplace" is affected by what other players are selling each round.
