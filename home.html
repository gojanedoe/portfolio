        Home is a typographic project consisting of two alternative book layouts
        that explore the personal, intimate, and reflective space that the
        laptop creates for its users. Inspired by the history of the personal
        computer and cyberspace, the layouts include a six-page fold-out
        brochure, and a 20-page accordion booklet.
