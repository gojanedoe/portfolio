        Storylines is a social, local multiplayer mobile game for 4-30 players
        where players compete to become the best storyteller. The game is driven
        by a mobile app, but the main interaction takes place between players
        who are sharing stories face to face.

        enables players to share, discuss and empathize with stories of
        empowerment.
