        Return is a single-player, puzzle platformer game where the player
        assumes the role of a wanderer seeking to bring a loved one back from
        the realm of the dead.
      </p>
      <p class="small-block-space">
        During gameplay, the character's lantern allows them to shift in and out
        of the spirit realm for a short time, giving them the ability to
        manipulate wisps, interact with sacred totems, and bypass unnatural
        man-made objects. Using the lantern, the player must solve puzzles and
        light various torches to open the way toward the one they're searching
        for.
