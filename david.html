        In David's Absence is an interactive installation where the audience
        investigates the disappearance of their acquaintance, David. Exploring
        past relationships and the artifacts left from them, this piece allows
        viewers to search through physical items and digital traces of the
        missing David to discover his history and whereabouts.
      </p>
      <p class="small-block-space">
        This room hides hints of his life and disappearance that document the
        end of his relationship and the subsequent isolation from friends and
        family. Items include artifacts from his last relationship, a
        password-protected laptop, a lockbox on his bookshelf, and an email
        address and password.
      </p>
      <p class="medium-block-space">
        During their exploration of the room, viewers also have the option to
        text a third-party character, Jeremy, if they need help or want to press
        for more information.
      </p>

If you could go check his place out at 1:00pm in Brown tomorrow (Sunday, February 26th), let me know. And I lost your phone number, could you send me a text at (redacted)?
