        The site includes text, images, gifs, and hyperlinks as the main source
        of visuals and interaction. The site narrator is an entity formed solely
        though information gathered on the internet. It struggles with opposing
        viewpoints and contradictory aspects that exist on the web, and uses
        text and images as a way to convey its observations and thoughts.
