        Interplay is an interactive installation that explores boundaries and
        play within digital and physical spaces. Using a laptop that controls
        the shape and movement of a projected circle, players may interact with
        other participants remotely by changing their projected environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants under the projection must stay inside the circle for it to
        stay green, creating incentive for them to expand their personal
        boundaries.
